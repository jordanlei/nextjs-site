                My research focus is understanding the neural and cognitive
                mechanisms of complex planning in humans. I use{" "}
                <b>reinforcement learning and deep learning models</b> to
                understand how people and animals think ahead. For more

            <ul>
              <li>
                Created a deep learning model of visual attention. Incorporated
                convolutions, recurrence, encoder-decoder architectures, and
                custom loss functions to build a model that replicates key
                features of biological attention, including inhibition of return
                and magnitude shifts in tuning curves. Work submitted as
                master's thesis.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compared biologically plausible and artificial learning
                algorithms. Analyzed common failure modes of biologically
                plausible Hebbian learning agents and backpropagation, such as
                catastrophic forgetting.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Worked with Sales and Operations Planning to speed up the cash
                flow reporting process. Created a full-stack web application in Python to
                automate reporting of statement of cash flows for Sales and
                Operations Planning - reduced cash flow reporting time by over
                80% and made the process interoperable with Microsoft Excel.
